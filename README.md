My first GUI-based game!<br><br>
The original <b>blackjack.py</b> file was written for a terminal-based card game.
However, this was a great opportunity to build another version with graphics using Tkinter and Pillow, resulting in <b>blackjack_gui.py (and the companion images.zip).</b>

Download blackjack.py or (blackjack_gui.py and images.zip) to play.
